# Kaggle Solutions Repository 🏅

Welcome! This repository contains my solutions, notebooks, and learning progress from various Kaggle competitions. 

My goal is to apply theoretical concepts from books like *"Hands-On Machine Learning"* by Aurélien Géron to real-world datasets, focusing on building clean, production-ready pipelines.
