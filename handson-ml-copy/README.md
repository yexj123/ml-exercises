# Hands-On Machine Learning (Notes & Exercises)

This folder contains my personal journey through the book **"Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow"** by Aurélien Géron.

### My Modifications
I have adapted the original notebooks to enhance my own learning process by:
* Adding detailed **personal notes** and explanations for complex concepts.
* Completing the **end-of-chapter exercises**.
* Experimenting with different hyperparameters and data visualizations.
* Updating code snippets to be compatible with my local environment.
